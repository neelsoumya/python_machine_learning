# Lecture Notes: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Biologists

## üß¨ Overview

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a **dimensionality reduction technique**. It transforms a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.

It is widely used in biology for:

* Gene expression analysis
* Population genetics
* Imaging data
* Single-cell RNA-seq

---

## üß† Intuition

Imagine you have a dataset with many variables (e.g. expression levels of 10,000 genes). PCA helps us:

* Reduce the number of variables
* Identify patterns
* Remove noise
* Visualize high-dimensional data

PCA finds **new axes** (called **principal components**) that capture the maximum variance in the data.

## üìä Key Concepts

### 1. **Variance**

* Variance = how spread out the data is.
* PCA finds directions (principal components) that maximize variance.

### 2. **Covariance Matrix**

* Tells us how variables vary together.
* PCA uses this to find directions where the data varies the most.

### 3. **Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues**

* Eigenvectors = directions (principal components)
* Eigenvalues = amount of variance explained by each component

## üß™ Step-by-Step PCA Procedure

Given a dataset with samples (rows) and features (columns):

1. **Standardize** the data (mean = 0, variance = 1)
2. **Compute the covariance matrix**
3. **Calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues**
4. **Sort** eigenvectors by decreasing eigenvalues
5. **Choose top k** eigenvectors (components)
6. **Project data** onto these components

## üî¨ Example: Gene Expression Data

* Rows = samples (patients)
* Columns = gene expression levels

### Goal:

* Reduce dimensionality from 20,000 genes to 2-3 PCs
* Visualize patterns between patient groups (e.g., healthy vs. cancer)

```python
# Sample Python code (requires numpy, sklearn, matplotlib)
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

X = ...  # gene expression matrix
X_scaled = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)

pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)

plt.scatter(X_pca[:, 0], X_pca[:, 1])
plt.xlabel('PC1')
plt.ylabel('PC2')
plt.title('PCA of Gene Expression')
plt.show()
```

## üìà Interpreting the Output

* **Scree plot**: plots variance explained by each PC
* **Loadings**: show how much each original variable contributes to each PC
* **Biplots**: show samples and variables in the same plot

---

## üß† PCA vs. Other Techniques

* PCA is **unsupervised** (no labels used)
* Works best for **linear** relationships
* Alternatives:

  * t-SNE / UMAP for nonlinear structures
  * LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) for classification tasks

---

## üß¨ In Practice: Tips for Biologists

* Always **standardize** data before PCA
* Use **log-transformation** for count data (e.g., RNA-seq)
* Be cautious interpreting PCs biologically‚ÄîPCs are **mathematical constructs**

## ‚ùì Q\&A

* Q: Can PCA tell me which genes are important?

  * A: It shows which genes contribute most to the components (loadings), but doesn't test statistical significance.

* Q: How many PCs should I keep?

  * A: Use the **elbow rule** on the scree plot or **choose enough PCs to explain \~90% variance**.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

* PCA = powerful tool for reducing and visualizing high-dimensional data
* Especially useful in biology for gene expression and population structure
* Remember: PCA simplifies data, but interpretation must remain biologically grounded
