## Introduction to Unsupervised Learning


- 📓 [Introduction to Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/neelsoumya/python_machine_learning/blob/main/intro_unsupervised.md)


## Normalization

Normalization is a crucial preprocessing step in machine learning that ensures each feature contributes equally to analysis by scaling data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is especially important for algorithms sensitive to the scale of input data.
