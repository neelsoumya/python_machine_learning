## Normalization

Normalization is a crucial preprocessing step in machine learning that ensures each feature contributes equally to analysis by scaling data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is especially important for algorithms sensitive to the scale of input data.

## Applications in Biology

### Single-Cell Analysis

Single-cell analysis is a powerful application of unsupervised machine learning in biology, enabling the exploration of cell diversity in complex tissues. This approach often involves clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques to reveal distinct cell populations based on their gene expression profiles.

The notebook [Single-Cell Unsupervised Analysis](https://github.com/neelsoumya/python_machine_learning/blob/main/singlcecell_unsupervised.ipynb) demonstrates:

- Loading real single-cell transcriptome data from 10x Genomics (PBMC 3K dataset)
- Preprocessing and quality control
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA and t-SNE/UMAP
- Clustering with the Leiden algorithm
- Visualization of results in reduced dimensions

This hands-on notebook is ideal for those interested in applying unsupervised learning to biological data.
