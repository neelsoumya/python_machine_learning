## Learning Objectives

### Day 1 (halfâ€‘day)
1. **Introduction to unsupervised learning and normalization:**  
   Understand the fundamental principles of unsupervised learning and recognize the role that data normalization plays in preparing datasets for analysis.

2. **Why normalization is required:**  
   Explain why normalization is necessary to ensure that features with different scales do not unduly influence unsupervised learning algorithms.

3. **Basics of PCA:**  
   Describe the core concepts of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), including how it reduces dimensionality by identifying directions of maximum variance.

---

### Day 2 (halfâ€‘day)
1. **PCA and tâ€‘SNE:**  
   Compare and contrast PCA and tâ€‘Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tâ€‘SNE) as two popular techniques for dimensionality reduction and data visualization.

2. **Basic applications of PCA:**  
   Apply PCA to real datasets, interpret the resulting principal components, and discuss how these components can reveal underlying structure.

3. **Basics of tâ€‘SNE:**  
   Explain how tâ€‘SNE projects highâ€‘dimensional data into two or three dimensions while preserving local similarities between points.

4. **Applications to data:**  
   Demonstrate the use of both PCA and tâ€‘SNE on sample datasets to visualize clustering tendencies and uncover hidden patterns.

5. **When *not* to apply PCA and tâ€‘SNE:**  
   Identify situations where PCA or tâ€‘SNE may produce misleading results or be computationally infeasible, and propose alternative strategies.

---

### Day 3 (halfâ€‘day)
1. **Clustering:**  
   Define clustering in the context of unsupervised learning and outline its importance in discovering groupings within data.

2. **Basics of kâ€‘means:**  
   Describe the kâ€‘means clustering algorithm, including how cluster centroids are initialized and updated to minimize withinâ€‘cluster variance.

3. **Basics of hierarchical clustering:**  
   Explain the steps of hierarchical clustering, heatmaps, agglomerative approaches, and interpret dendrograms.

4. **Situations in which you would want to apply hierarchical clustering:**  
   Discuss specific use cases: such as when the number of clusters is unknown or when a treeâ€‘based representation is desiredâ€”where hierarchical clustering is advantageous.

---

### Day 4 (halfâ€‘day)
1. **Practical applications:**  
   Explore realâ€‘world scenarios where unsupervised learning methods provide actionable insights across various domains.

2. **Curse of dimensionality:**  
   Explain the concept of the curse of dimensionality and its implications for the performance and interpretability of clustering and dimensionalityâ€‘reduction algorithms.

3. **Practical applications of PCA, tâ€‘SNE and hierarchical clustering to biological data:**  
   Apply PCA, tâ€‘SNE, and hierarchical clustering to biological datasets (e.g., gene expression or singleâ€‘cell data), interpret the results, and discuss biological insights gained.

## Normalization

Normalization is a crucial preprocessing step in machine learning that ensures each feature contributes equally to analysis by scaling data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is especially important for algorithms sensitive to the scale of input data.
