# Supervised Machine Learning

## Teaching Resources

This page contains resources for teaching supervised machine learning, including example notebooks and guides.

- [Linear Regression Example Notebook](https://github.com/neelsoumya/python_machine_learning/files/linear_regression.ipynb)

- Bias and fairness (recidivism dataset)
  
- Logistic regression log odds plots (can be used to detect bias and fairness)

- Also see binary response logistic regression models (https://cambiotraining.github.io/stats-glm/materials/glm-practical-logistic-binary.html)

- Animation of gradient descent using Vicki and Martin code see email `core_stats_slides-plot v3.qmd`
